Create cluster models using song data from spotify to find songs similar to one another
Our group plans to create cluster models (K Means, Mixture of Gaussian) to group similar
songs and see which songs may be recommended to a Spotify user after seeing their
playlists/favorite songs

The motivation was to find songs that varies depending on the day's mood and using the unsupervised learning to recommend similar taste of music can be more convenient than having to find individual songs. We used K-means, PCA, and Mixture of Gaussian which are all unsupervised methods.
